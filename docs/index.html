                        concerning these Terms of Use, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort,
                        or otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be
                        resolved only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act,
                        conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration
                        Association, or a similar arbitration service selected by the parties, in a location
                        mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's award shall be final, and judgment may

                        equitable action, proceeding, or arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms and

                        enforceability of this arbitration provision, shall be determined by the Arbitrator. This
                        arbitration provision shall survive the termination of these Terms of Use.

                        and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Utah in all
                        disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized
                        in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including,
                        without limitation, this section.
